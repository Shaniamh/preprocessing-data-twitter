1.06E+18,11/16/2018 4:13,i do not want to be brave i just want to be who i am
1.06E+18,11/15/2018 20:31,i would expect no less from a guy who uses klaus kinski for an avatar
1.06E+18,11/15/2018 19:44,it's an inner and outer conflict it sucks ass and i hate that it's part of the bigger game but it's something i
1.06E+18,11/15/2018 19:44,this is also one of my fears i have to face when i come out transition it's not the passing that i'm afraid of i
1.06E+18,11/15/2018 19:44,in a way it feels like the person doing the labeling is afraid of what i'm not sure conflict impurity parado
1.06E+18,11/15/2018 19:44,which brings me to the point i find it so strange when labels are used to file people into strict types you are
1.06E+18,11/15/2018 19:44,also personally i try not to give myself too many labels because i know i'll end up pigeonholing myself and i try
